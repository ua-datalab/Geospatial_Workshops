## About the Workshop 
Step out of conventional GIS frameworks and discover the latest trends in geospatial data science where open tools, cloud technologies, and the proliferation of sensor data are innovating earth observation and environmental monitoring. 

Emphasizing open science and reproducible methods, this immersive hands-on workshop series will:

* Guide you through essential geospatial python libraries
* Introduce you to cloud-native formats
* Show you how to harness cloud computing platforms
* Mentor you in open-source drone imagery analysis
* Help you build geospatial analysis pipelines

Each workshop session is designed to be a discrete lesson where students will walk away with specific knowledge on a tool and resources to explore deeper. Our goal is to cover material that is not currently being taught in credited classes at U of A.  

The series is **FREE** and open to all University of Arizona personnel and is tailored for graduate students, postdocs, and early career faculty looking to expand their geospatial skills. 



## The Instructor

The series is expert-led by educators at the [University of Arizona Data Science Institute](https://datascience.arizona.edu/) and [Cyverse](https://cyverse.org/).

## Prerequisites
We welcome students and professionals from any field of study across the university. A variety of skill levels are also welcome, though each lesson will assume the audience has limited experience on the topic. Basic knowledge of scripting languages (python/R), some prior geospatial experience, and familiarity with command line tools will be helpful. We will be doing gentle live coding during the sessions. Please bring you laptop computer if you plan on attending in-person. Specific software installations and login requirements will be posted for each lesson. 


## Documentation
In addition to the live workshops, all of the lesson content will be openly available in the Github repository wiki https://github.com/ua-datalab/Geospatial_Workshops/wiki
